# Stability Checklist (Manual)

Run these after any kernel or policy changes.

## Return without shame
- Bad week, no usage: no shame copy on return.
- Suggestions are optional and dismissible.

## Softening under pressure
- Multiple plan resets: system softens further (rest or smaller scope).
- Overloaded + low energy: Micro-Recovery only.

## Noise control
- Ignore all suggestions: system backs off (no extra nudges).
- Same suggestion type does not repeat inside 12 hours.

## Boundaries are gentle
- During rest window: no planning or return nudges.
- During late-night rest: only rest or reflection suggestions.
- During focus protection: no small-task nudges.
