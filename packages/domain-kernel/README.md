# Domain Kernel

Shared pure domain logic for Life OS behavior.

This package is the Phase 1 kernel unification target:

1. Canonical domain types.
2. Pure reducer and policy logic.
3. Shared feature-flag and trace primitives.
4. Test harness helpers for deterministic fixtures.

No backend runtime APIs or UI framework imports are allowed here.
